cc project 4: digital divination


INSPIRATION

When thinking about what I wanted my divination application to be, I was pretty lost for a while, but I enjoyed the RiTa functions that we had learnt in class, and all the weird sentences that it could produce. After a while, I realized one of my favorite divination tools was the Magic 8-Ball. It's so simple, cheap, and gimicky-- just a black orb filled with fluid that will tell you one of twenty things, all inscribed on a little icosohedron. It's pretty tacky, but so enigmatic to me, with all the importance tied to the 8-ball in billiards, the blue fluid that makes the inside feel so mystic, like gazing into a hole right into the stars. It's just cool! 

So with that, my tool would become a magic 8-ball, but with unique responses.

DESIGN PROCESS

I prerendered the 8-ball and the "Fortune Prism" in Blender, trying to make it look really clean and realistic. I've been working hard in my 3D skillset on making good looking renders with an emphasis on good, realistic lighting. I study toy photography a lot to learn how it works in real life, and then apply it to Blender since the Cycles rendering engine does a great job of simulating realistic light bounces. 

Once I had my objects, they were inserted into my site, and transposed over an intentionally white background, for focus on the ball and the fortune prism. After that, I transplanted the demo tools we made in class for RiTa generation into those elements, and created a style element for <p> that would orient the text properly into the fortune prism.
  
The text result is based from each possible result in a magic 8-ball, mixed into unique responses that have a range of eclecticity and coherence.

EXECUTION
  
I really like how this came out, despite how simple it is. I wish that the results weren't so noticably similar once you've been clicking the ball for a while, but whenever I fed the generator more sentences to draw from, the more it broke and would select from a smaller pool, for some reason. Despite this, the possiblities are still amusing.
